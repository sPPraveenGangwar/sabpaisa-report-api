   .\create_directories.ps1
   ```
3. **Press F5 again** - It should work now!

## 🎯 Solution 2: Already Fixed in VS Code!

The application has been updated to automatically create directories when you press F5.

## 📝 What Changed?

We've updated the application to:

## 🛠️ Manual Fix (if needed)

If the automatic fix doesn't work, manually create these directories in your project folder:

```
sabpaisa-reports-api/
├── logs/           ← Create this
├── media/          ← Create this
│   ├── exports/    ← Create this
│   └── reports/    ← Create this
├── static/         ← Create this
├── staticfiles/    ← Create this
├── exports/        ← Create this
└── reports/        ← Create this
```

## 🔄 Complete Reset (if all else fails)

1. **Delete** the `.venv` folder
2. **Open** `sabpaisa-reports-api.code-workspace` in VS Code
3. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open Debug panel
4. **Select** "📦 Setup & Migrate" from dropdown
5. **Press** F5 - This will recreate everything

## ✨ The Application is Now Fixed!

The error you encountered has been permanently fixed. When you:
