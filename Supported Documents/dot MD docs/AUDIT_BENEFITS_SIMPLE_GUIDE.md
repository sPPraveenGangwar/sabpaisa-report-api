## 📖 Part 1: Understanding Audits (No Technical Terms!)

### What is an Audit?
Think of an audit like a **report card check** by regulators.
- Government checks if we're following payment rules (RBI audit)
- Credit card companies check if we're protecting card data (PCI DSS audit)

### Why Do We Need Audits?

**Simple Answer**: It's the LAW!
- Like how restaurants need health inspections
- Like how schools need education board checks
- We need RBI and PCI DSS audits to operate legally

### What Happens if We Fail Audit?

**Bad Things**:
- ❌ **Heavy Fines**: ₹5 Lakhs to ₹25 Lakhs (or more!)
- ❌ **License Cancelled**: We can't do business
- ❌ **Bank Stops Working with Us**: No payment processing
- ❌ **Customers Leave**: Trust is broken
- ❌ **Legal Problems**: Court cases, bad reputation

**Good News**: Our system helps us **PASS** audits easily!
